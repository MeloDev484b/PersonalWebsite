        <h3><a href="https://github.com/MeloDev484b/SchedulingApp">Scheduling App</a> - Software II</h3>
        <p>This software is capable of adding, removing, and modifying customer and appointment records, and includes localization for French and English. I was provided with an Entity-Relationship digram and tasked with designing the GUI, and UML diagram before building the application. This scheduling application is written in Java, built with JavaFX, and utilizes the JDBC API to store data in the user's database. </p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/MeloDev484b/InventorySystem">Inventory Management System</a> - Software I</h3>
        <p>I was tasked with prototyping a GUI application with a provided UML diagram, a storyboard and a list of desired functionalities. This software is capable of adding, removing, and modifying parts and products. When a product is added, parts are associated with that product. This inventory management system was written in Java and built with JavaFX.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/MeloDev484b/BuildingGame">Building Game</a> - Personal project</h3>
        <p>Building Game is a 2D resource-gathering simulation. Currently, it is a work-in-progress that I have been using to learn about game design and development. Building Game currently features a building system that validates construction, starving mechanics that cause citizens to leave if they are not fed, 6 buildings with different behaviors, and various panels for the player to interact with. It is written in GDScript and built with the Godot game engine.</p>
